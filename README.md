## Synopsis

**jallsky** is a `node.js` system control for the **SBIG AllSky 340M Camera**.
Its development stage is **in a pre-alpha phase**, and will be used at the **OARPAF** (*Regional Astronomical Observatory of the Antola Reserve, Fascia*).

It takes inspiration from the following `python` drivers:

 - https://github.com/badders/pyallsky
 - https://github.com/saltastro/skycam

It provides following features:

 - A `node.js` driver to communicate with the camera: 
   it is a `node.js` translation of the `pyallsky` code.
 - A **web page** to control the camera:
   it is a simple interface based on `bootstrap` 4.
 - A link to the [node-fits](https://github.com/Nunkiii/node-fits) github module:
   this module allows using data from the AllSky Camera to treate FITS files and png images, and to add custom FITS header keys. It also creates a simple histogram of the values of the image.
 - A set of `mongodb` functions to save informations about observations:
   these observations are mainly key headers containing image informations, timing, and filesystem paths of the locations where fits and png images are stored.
 - A **websocket** server to broadcast camera and db informations;
 - a `node.js` video script to create an animation of last images (IN PROGRESS).

## Motivation

This project is born to provide the [OARPAF observatory](http://www.orsa.unige.net) with the best AllSkyCamera system and to help its robotization process.
The final goal is to integrate [webGL features](https://github.com/Nunkiii/XD-1) to dynamically change image cuts; to provide a web interface to dynamically browse the image db, and to  add overlays to the image containing the position of celestial objects and of the OARPAF 80cm telescope during pointing, improving ESO solutions such as the [La Silla AllSky Camera](http://www.ls.eso.org/lasilla/dimm/lasc/). 

## Installation

Due to the early development stage, the installation process is quite articulated.

### Installing the latest `node.js` version

The latest `node.js` version (7.9) supports async/await functions which are very helpful in our case.

```bash
cd /usr/local/	
wget https://nodejs.org/dist/v7.9.0/node-v7.9.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
tar --strip-components 1 -xf node-v7.9.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
ln -s /usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js /usr/local/bin/node-gyp
rm CHANGELOG.md LICENSE README.md node-v7.9.0-linux-x64.tar.xz
```

### Cloning the repository

Enter into your favourite git directory, or mkdir it:

```bash
cd ~ # or your git directory
git clone https://github.com/vertighel/jallsky.git
cd jallsky/
npm -f install
```

<!-- Creating directories to store fits files and png images -->

<!--     mkdir ./mnt ./mnt/fits ./mnt/png -->

Installing the `node-fits` module, necessary in order to convert the images of the camera to FITS and png files:

```bash
cd node-modules/
git clone https://github.com/Nunkiii/node-fits.git
sudo apt-get install g++ libpng-dev libjpeg9-dev libcfitsio3-dev 
cd node-fits
node-gyp configure
node-gyp build
```

### Installing the additional components

Installing `bootstrap`, which provide a mobile-first html, css and js framework:

```bash
cd ~ # or your git directory
git clone https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap.git
```

Installing `mongodb`, necessary to store the information and metadata relative to the saved images, and creating the collection which will contain these information:

```bash
sudo apt-get install mongodb
mongo
db.createCollection(allskycam)
exit
```

## Configuration

`./config.json` and `./header_template.json` contain information about image storing, connection to the database, and FITS  header keys.

## Launch

```bash
./server.2.js
```

If you have an installed web server, for example **apache**, open your browser on `localhost` at `page.2.html`, and launch observations.
The idea is to make this page a configuration page, password-protected. The page `external.html` will be the front end for everyone.


<!-- ## API Reference -->

<!-- Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live. -->

<!-- ## Tests -->

<!-- Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples. -->
