Leap years, leap seconds, epochs, different calendars using the same nomenclature, different countries using different calendars at the same time, etc.\n\nThis library doesn't even try to cope with all that shit.\n\nIf you want to display calendar dates in format appropriate for a given culture at a given time in history - well, first of all, good luck to you. For example, the [*October* Revolution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Revolution) took place in what most of us now call *November*. That's because in Tsar's Russia they still used obsolete Julian calendar until bolsheviks finally adopted Gregorian. Hey thanks, Lenin!\n\nLuckily for historians and astronomers, they can just say the revolution began on 2421540 Julian Day, and that's the whole point. You don't mess with naming days, you just count them. Day 0 would be *1 January 4713 BC*. Or is that *27 Nov 4714 BC*? Fuck.\n\n## license\n\nMIT\n\n## author\n\nStepan Stolyarov <stepan.stolyarov@gmail.com>\n",
